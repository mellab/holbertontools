Included is a quick script to act as a wrapper for the two individual scripts
that make up the Betty checker for Holberton School C code.

Just drop the script into your $PATH and set permissions to use it.

The script assumes you've pulled the Betty repo from your $HOME.
If you haven't, the script will automatically pull the GitHub repo
from your $HOME directory, so if you have already downloaded it, and
don't want it to be redownloaded, set the BETTYHOME variable in the script
to point to the folder the repo was pulled in.
