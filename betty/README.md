Included is a quick script to act as a wrapper for the two individual scripts
that make up the Betty checker for Holberton School C code.

Just drop the script into your $PATH and set permissions to use it.

This script will automatically install betty from Github if you haven't already!
Just run it as root once to install the necessary scripts.
