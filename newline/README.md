Newline Checking Script
By Tim Britton, last edited 11/Oct/2016

Easy to use newline checking script. Checks the last byte of the file for a blank character.

Just run it against any file to see if there's a newline at the end.

Currently does not support multiple arguments (such as wildcard characters), but coming soon.
